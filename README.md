Beautiful PHP
=============

Everyone loves to bash PHP. Like any workhorse, it gets little praise when it works properly, and all the blame when something goes wrong.

Also, most people who bash it seem to believe the language hasn't changed in ten years.

It's time to end the misconception, and you can help!

If you've seen beautiful PHP code in the wild, consider submitting an example. Alternatively, you could contribute a clean and concise demonstration of programming concepts through the lens of PHP.

If you find you're always getting into arguments about one methodology over another (such as the ever-popular "That's Not MVC" or "You're doing OOP wrong"), maybe you could contribute a reference sample that everyone could learn from.
